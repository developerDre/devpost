// Date:	January 14, 2019
//
// Summary:
//			In programming, it is essential to keep
// clean code, both aesthetically and functionally.
// One way to do this is to use functions.
//			Generally speaking, a function is a set
// of statements whose job is to do a certain task.
// Functions serve the purpose of simplifying code
// by dividing complicated programs into manageable
// pieces. Functions are also helpful because they
// can also be used multiple times in a program.
// ************************************************

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int printHello();					// Function deceleration (also called prototype) *

int main(){
	printHello();					// Function call (execute this function)
	return 0;
}

int printHello(){					// Function definition **
	cout << "Hello World!\n";		// Code within function
	return 0;
}									// End of function

// *	Function decelerations must ALWAYS be before "int main()".
// **	Function definitions can be either before or after main.

// NOTE:	In some cases the compiler may allow for the function
// to be defined and declared in the same block of code. In this
// case, the function would be written as the definition but would
// appear before "int main()".
