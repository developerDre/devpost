// Topic:	C++ Predefined Functions
// Date:	January 18, 2019
//
// Summary:
//			User-Defined functions are helpful when
// it comes to simplicity of code. However, writing
// functions to do complex tasks such as changing a
// the case of a character from upper to lower can
// be a challenge.
//			This is where Predefined functions play
// a role. Predefined functions are simply functions
// that can be included into a program without the
// need to define them.
// ************************************************

#include <iostream>
#include <cctype>										// cctype is included for the use of the predefined toupper() function
using namespace std;

int main(){
	char x;
	cout << "enter a letter: ";
	cin >> x;
	
	cout << "The letter is: " << toupper(x) << '\n';	// The toupper() function does not need to be declared or defined because it was included from the cctype library 
	
	return 0;
