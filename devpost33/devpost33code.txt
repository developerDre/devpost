# Summary:
#			Compiling programs with relatively small
# amounts of code takes little time, however, larger
# programs can take much longer. Even if a minor
# change is made to a program, if the whole program
# is re-compiled, valuable time can be lost.
#			One way to avoid this problem is to use
# the program called "make". Make uses a script to
# compile, so it does not have the same format as a
# C++ program.

# List source .cpp files separated by spaces (no header files)

# Name object files the same as their respective .cpp files
OBJECTS=$(SOURCES:.cpp=.o)

# Part that compiles the program
# The output file will be called "Program"
Start: $(SOURCES) Program
